    "The CMA welcomes contributions to selene. If you spot a bug, or think of a potential enhancement to selene - please describe it in an issue using the given template. For small bugs, please feel free to work on the fix yourself by forking the repository and working on a pull request. For larger feature requests, we would prefer to discuss before launching into developing new code. Any contributions to selene should be generic and not website-specific.\n",
